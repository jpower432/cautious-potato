# pt-8 - \[\] Computer Matching Requirements

## Control Statement

When a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a matching program:

- \[a.\] Obtain approval from the Data Integrity Board to conduct the matching program;

- \[b.\] Develop and enter into a computer matching agreement;

- \[c.\] Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register;

- \[d.\] Independently verify the information produced by the matching program before taking adverse action against an individual, if required; and

- \[e.\] Provide individuals with notice and an opportunity to contest the findings before taking adverse action against an individual.

## Control guidance

The [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) establishes requirements for federal and non-federal agencies if they engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll records. A federal benefit match is performed to determine or verify eligibility for payments under federal benefit programs or to recoup payments or delinquent debts under federal benefit programs. A matching program involves not just the matching activity itself but also the investigative follow-up and ultimate action, if any.
