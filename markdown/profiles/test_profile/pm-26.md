# pm-26 - \[\] Complaint Management

## Control Statement

Implement a process for receiving and responding to complaints, concerns, or questions from individuals about the organizational security and privacy practices that includes:

- \[a.\] Mechanisms that are easy to use and readily accessible by the public;

- \[b.\] All information necessary for successfully filing complaints;

- \[c.\] Tracking mechanisms to ensure all complaints received are reviewed and addressed within {{ insert: param, pm-26_prm_1 }};

- \[d.\] Acknowledgement of receipt of complaints, concerns, or questions from individuals within {{ insert: param, pm-26_prm_2 }}; and

- \[e.\] Response to complaints, concerns, or questions from individuals within {{ insert: param, pm-26_prm_3 }}.

## Control guidance

Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as valuable sources of input to organizations and ultimately improve operational models, uses of technology, data collection practices, and controls. Mechanisms that can be used by the public include telephone hotline, email, or web-based forms. The information necessary for successfully filing complaints includes contact information for the senior agency official for privacy or other official designated to receive complaints. Privacy complaints may also include personally identifiable information which is handled in accordance with relevant policies and processes.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
