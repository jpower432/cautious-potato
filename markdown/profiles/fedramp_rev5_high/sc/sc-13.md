    # This section contains the parameters that are part of this control.
  # Each parameter has properties. Only the profile-values and display-name properties are editable.
  # The other properties are informational.
  #
  # The values property for a parameter represents values inherited from the OSCAL catalog.
  # To override the catalog settings, use bullets under profile-values as shown below:
  #
  #   profile-values:
  #     - value 1
  #     - value 2
  #
  # If the "- <REPLACE_ME>" placeholder appears under profile-values, it is the same as if
  # the profile-values property were left empty.
  #
  # Some parameters may show an aggregates property which lists other parameters. This means
  # the parameter value is made up of the values from the other parameters. For parameters
  # that aggregate, profile-values is not applicable.
  #
  # Property param-value-origin is meant for putting the origin from where that parameter comes from.
  # In order to be changed in the current profile, profile-param-value-origin property will be displayed with
  # the placeholder "<REPLACE_ME>" for you to be replaced. If a parameter already has a param-value-origin
  # coming from an inherited profile, do no change this value, instead use profile-param-value-origin as follows:
  #
  #    param-value-origin: DO NOT REPLACE - this is the original value
  #    profile-param-value-origin: <REPLACE_ME> - replace the new value required HERE

# sc-13 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Determine the {{ insert: param, sc-13_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b.\] Implement the following types of cryptography required for each specified cryptographic use: {{ insert: param, sc-13_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions, including the protection of classified information and controlled unclassified information, the provision and implementation of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. For example, organizations that need to protect classified information may specify the use of NSA-approved cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital signatures may specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

## Control item

### guidance

This control applies to all use of cryptography. In addition to encryption, this includes functions such as hashing, random number generation, and key generation. Examples include the following:

* Encryption of data
* Decryption of data
* Generation of one time passwords (OTPs) for MFA
* Protocols such as TLS, SSH, and HTTPS




The requirement for FIPS 140 validation, as well as timelines for acceptance of FIPS 140-2, and 140-3 can be found at the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program

### guidance

For NSA-approved cryptography, the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) oversees a national program to evaluate Commercial IT Products for Use in National Security Systems. The NIAP Product Compliant List can be found at the following location:

https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Product/index.cfm

### guidance

When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some IaaS/PaaS provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly configured.

### guidance

Moving to non-FIPS CM or product is acceptable when:

* FIPS validated version has a known vulnerability
* Feature with vulnerability is in use
* Non-FIPS version fixes the vulnerability
* Non-FIPS version is submitted to NIST for FIPS validation
* POA&M is added to track approval, and deployment when ready


### guidance

At a minimum, this control applies to cryptography in use for the following controls: AU-9(3), CP-9(8), IA-2(6), IA-5(1), MP-5, SC-8(1), and SC-28(1).
